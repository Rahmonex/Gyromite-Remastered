# Gyromite



## Getting started

The project represents a remaster for the old game Gyromite that came out in october 1985.
The objective of this code is to make a Java app of Gyromite (a 2D platformer) that can be launched on Computer and can be played.

The game is initially coded with Java and Java Swing but some changes might happen (Pass from Swing to JavaFX).
Don't hesitate to contribute !

## How to launch the game

The part of the code that launches the game is located in main.java, so just launch main.java and the game will be executed.
